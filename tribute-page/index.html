      <p>A timeline of Mr. Jones' life:</p>
      <br>
  <ul id="tribute-info">
    <li>1893: Jones was born in Covington, Kentucky to an Irish father and African-American mother.</li>
    <li>His mother left the family and his father struggled to raise him, by age 11 Jones he was on his own. He left school in 6th grade and moved to Ohio.</li>
    <li>He worked odd jobs to survive and by age 14 was an auto mechanic. He was largely self-taught.</li>
    <li>1912: Jones moved to Hallock, Minnesota, where he worked as a mechanic on a 50,000-acre (200 km2) farm. The farm was owned by James J. Hill, who was also owner of the Great Northern Railroad. Jones' proximity to Hill and the railroad facilitated his education in electricity and steam locomotive engines. He received his engineering license at age 20 and lived there for over 20 years.</li>
    <li>He took part in World War I in an all-black unit until his mechanical skills were spotted and he was promoted to sergeant working as an electrician and even teaching other soldiers his knowledge.</li>
    <li>After service with the U.S. Army in World War I, Jones returned to Hallock. He worked as a mechanic while learning about electronics. He built a transmitter for the town's first radio station. He also invented a device to combine sound with motion pictures.</li>
    <li>1927: Local entrepreneur, Joseph A. Numero, hired Jones as an electrical engineer to improve the audio equipment made by his firm. Jones worked on converting silent movie projectors into audiovisual projectors. Jones also patented a ticket dispensing machine for movie theaters.</li>
    <li>Along with continuing his developments in radio including improving transmitters and personal radio sets, he created a portable x-ray machine doctors could take to housebound patients. Regrettably, it never crossed Jones' mind to apply for patents and he had to watch as other men made fortunes off of his early inventions.</li>
    <li>1938: following a request by Numero, Jones began designing the Thermo Control Model A automatic truck refrigeration unit. Jones designed the portable air-cooling unit for trucks carrying perishable food to prevent spoilage. In 1941, Jones completed development of the Model C, which was mounted to the front of the truck. It was compact, light, and withstood road travel vibrations. In 1939, Jones filed for a patent for the Model A and received a patent for it on July 12, 1949.</li>
    <li>Jones formed a new company with Numero and he sold his movie sound equipment business to RCA, they formed the U.S. Thermo Control Company (later the Thermo King Corporation) which became a $3 million business by 1949. Portable cooling units designed by Jones were especially important during World War II, preserving blood, medicine, and food for use at army hospitals and on open battlefields. Model C units were manufactured for military use, following the war the units became available for commercial use.</li>
    <li>The invention ushered in the era of frozen foods, large supermarkets, and the modern restaurant industry. Refrigerated transport made the delivery of fresh produce anywhere in the country a possibility, and more affordable, regardless of the season.</li>
    <li>1991: The National Medal of Technology was posthumously awarded to Frederick M. Jones. President George Bush presented the award to his widow at a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden. Jones was the first African American to receive the award.</li>
    <li>1997: Ingersoll Rand acquired Thermo King from Westinghouse for $2.56 billion in cash, 13 times earnings and added it to its Climate Control Technologies (later Climate Solutions) businesses, alongside Trane and Hussmann. At the time Thermo King controlled close to half the global market for refrigeration equipment.</li>
